# JBS-Series
He who seeks will always find :D - Sports Japanese Business-Sedan (JBS)

Hello everyone!

I publish a car inspired by the idea of ​​the classic JBX100 mod by AX53. A sport sedan straight from the 90s, a purebred Japanese, which was released only on the domestic market. Made it serial to combine several generations in one mod. Modeled from scratch, based on the restyled Ibishu BX-Series.

---
### Lore

The 90s are the heyday of Ibishu - a plethora of cool sedans, some for the domestic market only, one of which is the Ibishu JBS-Series. Based on the extended Ibishu BX-Series platform, the sedan becomes a must-have for any self-respecting office worker. Yes, it is not as huge and luxurious as the Ibishu Diadem, but it is significantly cheaper and easier to maintain. Thanks to its familiar platform, it was loved by auto-enthusiasts and was warmly received in the automotive community.

### About the car

* The model is a separate car, independent of the BX updates.
* Lots of customizable parts (and more in WIP), from the ability to add a street handbrake to interior glow lights (activate with Alt + N, like underglow lights).
* Two generations (for now the only difference is in the rear optics, updates will come) - S90 and S100.
* Opening doors, trunk, hood (and WIP for sunroof, but it can already be tested).
* New interior colors, an LCD display and a carbon dashboard are available (the dashboard temporarily repeats the BX, but there will be variations, for example, for the S100).
* Functional buttons on dash - optics, ignition, sunroof control.
* The body kit has been redesigned for sedan and combined into kits (Type 1, 2, 3).
Created own engine models:
* Inline six with two classic configurations of 2.5 and 3.0 liters, turbocharged and naturally aspirated versions.
* V8 engine (according to Lore, from the more luxurious Ibishu cars) - 4.0-liter configuration with and without a compressor.
* Custom-made roll cages (based on Pro-Diadem models).
* Custom-made front and rear optics.

The mod is made individually, so global updates will not come out quickly. Suggestions on what exactly YOU want to see in the mod - it will be nice to read in the comments.

If you noticed a problem, can explain in detail how it happens - be sure to write about it in the comments, I will try to fix it.

Let's respect each other's work - if you liked the mod - write about it, give a good rating, if you didn't like it at all, skip it.
